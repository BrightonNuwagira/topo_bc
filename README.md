# Topological Data Analysis for Breast Cancer Detection (topo_bc)

This repository implements **Topological Data Analysis (TDA)** methods integrated with **Deep Learning (DL)** models for breast cancer detection, as described in our paper Topology Meets Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Detection.

## Features
- Topological feature extraction using persistent homology.
- Integration with CNNs and Vision Transformers (VTs).
- Applications to multiple breast ultrasound datasets.
